# Desktop Kana
`[WORK IN PROGRESS]`

An offline hiragana &amp; katakana learning aid written in Rust, inspired by [Real Kana](https://realkana.com/).  
A legacy Python version is also available.

**External Dependencies**  
To use either the Rust or Python CLIs your machine must support UTF-8 character encoding.  Windows users can enable beta UTF-8 support in their locale settings.  Linux users should ensure they have fonts installed that provide coverage for at least standard Japanese characters, e.g. Noto, and that they have generated a UTF-8 locale, e.g. en_GB.utf8 or en_US.utf8.
