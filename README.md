**External Dependencies**  
This project has no external dependencies.  
  
However, to use the CLI your machine must support UTF-8 character encoding.  Windows users can enable beta UTF-8 support in their locale settings.  Linux users should ensure they have fonts installed that provide coverage for Japanese characters, e.g. Noto, and that they have generated a UTF-8 locale, e.g. en_GB.utf8 or en_US.utf8.
